# csi: CloudShell Interface

`csi` is a command-line interface for [AWS CloudShell](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudshell) which brings CloudShell to your terminal where it belongs.

It allows you to manage and connect to VPC and non-VPC CloudShell sessions directly from your command line.

## Key features

* **List and manage** CloudShell environments
* **Create VPC environments** with specific VPC, subnets, and security groups
* **Connect** to CloudShell environments via SSM in the terminal
* **Download and upload files** between your machine and CloudShell environments
* **Execute commands** remotely on CloudShell environments
* **Genie** - magically creates a CloudShell with the right network access to reach:
    * hostnames/IP addresses and ports
    * EC2 instances
    * RDS databases

## Why use csi?

Unfortunately, CloudShell is only available on the AWS console. There's no official support in the AWS CLI or any AWS SDK.

The only way to use CloudShell outside of the console is by making [sigv4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html) signed requests to the correct endpoints.

`csi` handles all these requests for you and provides a sleek interface with custom commands to make CloudShell easier to use.

## Why care about CloudShell?

In June 2024, Amazon announced the ability to spin up CloudShell environments in a VPC, subnets, and security groups of your choice.

This is extremely useful for troubleshooting issues:
* boot time is about half a minute, much faster than spinning up an ec2
* environments are ephemeral, which can be useful for testing and quick tasks
* you only pay for data transfer, [no additional fees](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/pricing)

## Setup

1. Install dependencies using `uv` or `pip`
2. If you wish to use `csi ssm`, `csi execute`, or `csi genie`, you **must** have the [AWS Session Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html) somewhere in your `PATH`
3. Run `csi`

## Warnings

* This tool is not an official tool by Amazon/AWS
* Beware of the [service quotas for CloudShell](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/cloudshell.html#limits_cloudshell), specifically the adjustable 200 monthly hour limit **applied across all** IAM principals within an account.
* This tool is [GPLv3 licensed](./LICENSE) - there is no warranty. If you reach service limits in your account, contact AWS support.
* CloudShell environments exist per IAM principal. When assuming a role, make sure to do so with a unique role session name for yourself.

## Example usage

You can refer by the identifier or name of a CloudShell environment in commands

### Listing CloudShell environments

```bash
$ csi ls
90356db8-8797-4d97-b776-2fb3696e0132  default                       RUNNING
d29340e9-d1a5-4509-964a-df67271410cf  csi-i-0441309a8e1338cd1-443   SUSPENDED  vpc-00235e1cd5f421ea3  subnet-09109a275b488cb8b
e8278021-e179-4e44-9e7d-6fedd64960f1  csi-rds                       SUSPENDED  vpc-00235e1cd5f421ea3  subnet-09109a275b488cb8b,subnet-0c8fb515762607bcc
```

### Creating a CloudShell environment

```bash
# Create a default environment
$ csi create

# Create a named environment in a specific VPC
$ csi create --name my-vpc-shell --subnets subnet-01234567890abcdef --security-groups sg-01234567890abcdef
```

### Managing CloudShell environments

```bash
# Start an environment
$ csi start default
$ csi start 90356db8-8797-4d97-b776-2fb3696e0132

# Stop an environment
$ csi stop default
$ csi stop 90356db8-8797-4d97-b776-2fb3696e0132

# Delete an environment
$ csi delete default
$ csi delete 90356db8-8797-4d97-b776-2fb3696e0132
```

### Connecting to a CloudShell environment via Systems Manager (SSM)

```bash
$ csi ssm default

Starting session with SessionId: 1743751285551588149-un38ksdoyu7u7suz6li3vx53r4
~ $ whoami
cloudshell-user
```

### Executing commands on a CloudShell environment

```bash
$ csi execute default -c 'aws s3 ls'
```

### Uploading and Downloading files

```bash
$ csi upload default /tmp/data.sql /tmp/data.sql

$ csi download default /tmp/data.sql /tmp/
```

### Magic Genie

Genie magically creates a CloudShell with the correct network access to reach the resource you specify.

Temporary genie environments can be created with `--tmp`

```bash
# Connect to an EC2 instance on port 22
$ csi genie --ec2 i-01234567890abcdef --port 22

# Connect to an RDS instance
$ csi genie --rds my-database-instance

# Connect to a specific IP and port
$ csi genie --ip 10.0.0.123 --port 3306

# Connect to a hostname and port (note this hostname must be externally resolvable)
$ csi genie --host internal-service.example.com --port 8080

# Create a temporary environment that will be deleted after use with --tmp
$ csi genie --ec2 i-01234567890abcdef --port 22 --tmp
```

## Roadmap

* [x] Use name of environment instead of IDs when issuing commands
* [x] Inject credentials
* [x] Upload files
* [x] Download files
* [x] genie: re-use existing environments if the VPC configuration is compatible
* [x] Genie mode for IP/EC2/RDS access
* [x] Temporary environments
* [ ] Port tunneling (hard)
